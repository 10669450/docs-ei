In-build extensions offers a wide variety of options to do data transformation. Below is a list of all extension this can provide data transform functionalities. These will be linked to extension documentation pages or better yet list functions from each extention. 
 - Siddhi-execution-math : Can perform mathematical operations and transform data
 - Siddhi-execution-unitconversion : Can perform unit conversions ranging from length, weight, volume etc
 - Siddhi-execution-string : Can perform string manipulations
 - Siddhi-execution-time : Can perform time based transformations like converting time zones 
 - Siddhi-execution-map : Can convert events into maps and perform transformations like concatenating and removing 
 attributes
 - Siddhi-execution-reorder : Can rectify the order of incoming event flow
 - Siddhi-execution-json : Can perform manipulations to json strings

## Transform data using custom function calls
Siddhi-script-js to write custom function calls 

## Transforming between message formats (XML to JSON etc)
Will be explained using consuming and publishing sections
