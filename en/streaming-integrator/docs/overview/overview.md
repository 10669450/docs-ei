# Overview of WSO2 Streaming Integrator


Overview

WSO2 Streaming Integrator(SI) is a streaming data processing server that allows you to integrate streaming data and take action based on streaming data. This runtime intends to deliver the streaming integration capabilties of EI

WSO2 SI has the following capabilities:

- **Realtime ETL**: CDC for DBs, tailing files, scraping HTTP Endpoints, etc.
- **Work with streaming messaging systems**: It is fully compatible with Kafka and NATS and provides advanced stream processing capabilities required to utlize the full potential of streaming data.
- **Streaming data Integration**: Allows you to treat all data sources as streams and connect such streams with any destination.
- **Execute complex integrations based on streaming data**: SI has native support to work hand-in-hand with WSO2 Micro integrator, so that complex integration flows can be triggered based on decisions derived via stateful stream processing logic.


Itâ€™s powered by [Siddhi.io](https://siddhi.io/), a well known cloud native open source stream processing engine. Siddhi allows you to write complex stream processing logic using an intuitive SQL-like language known as [SiddhiQL](https://siddhi.io/en/v5.0/docs/). You can perform the following actions on the fly using Siddhi queries and constructs.

- **Transforming** your data from one format to another (e.g., to/from XML, JSON, AVRO, etc.).
- **Enriching** data received from a specific source by combining it with databases, and services, via inline calculations as well as using custom functions.
- **Correlating** data streams by joining multiple streams to create an aggregate stream.
- **Cleaning** data by filtering it and by modifying the content (e.g., obfuscating) in messages.
- Deriving **insights** by identifying interesting patterns and sequences of events in data streams.
- **Summarizing** data as and when it is generated using temporal windows and incremental time series aggregations.

WSO2 SI allows you to connect to any data source with any destination regardless of the different protocols and data formats used by the different endpoints. WSO2 SI has 60+ prebuilt and well tested collection of connectors that can be used to connect to various sources and destinations. The SI Store API can expose aggregated and collected data streams to in-memory and persistence storages via a REST API. With store, you can fetch row data as well execute queries and generate summarized information on demand via ad-hoc queries.

The [SI tooling](https://github.com/wso2/streaming-integrator-tooling) provides a web-based IDE that allows you to build Siddhi applications using a drag-and-drop graphical editor, or using a streaming SQL editor with intelligence, syntax coloring etc. It also has the capability to simulate and replay data streams and debug Siddhi queries so that you can test your Siddhi applications prior to deployment. Furthermore, you can directly deploy the Siddhi applications on a SI server through the IDE, or export them as K8s artifacts or as a Docker image.

WSO2 SI can be deployed in VM, Docker or K8s easily. It is container-friendly by design with a small image size, low resource footprint, a startup time less than two seconds, etc. SI has native support for Kubernetes with a [K8s Operator] (https://siddhi.io/en/v5.1/docs/siddhi-as-a-kubernetes-microservice/) designed to provide a convenient way of deploying SI on a K8s cluster with a single command by eliminating the need for manual configurations. You can achieve high availability with zero data loss with two nodes of SI.

Synapse integration flows deployed in [WSO2 Micro Integration(MI)] (https://github.com/wso2/micro-integrator) can be executed directly by SI. This allows you to build robust data processing and integration pipelines by combining powerful stream processing and integration capabilities.
