# Observability Solutions

This section explains how to set up the observability solutions for WSO2 Enterprise Integrator.

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator offers two observability solutions referred to as the classic observability deployment and cloud native observability deployment.

If you already have an observability stack such as ELK,  or if you want more business analytics and less operational observability, it is recommended for you to use the Classic Observability Deployment. For more information about this solution, see [Classic Observability Deployment](../../administer-and-observe/using-the-analytics-dashboard.md).

If you are creating a new cloud-native deployment or if you have Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger as your in-house monitoring and observability tools, you can set  up and use the Cloud Native Observability Solution. For more information about this solution, see [Cloud Native Observability Solution](../../administer-and-observe/cloud-native-observability-dashboards.md).
