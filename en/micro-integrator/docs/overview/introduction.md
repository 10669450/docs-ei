# Introduction

Systems integration is at the heart of any digital transformation. With WSO2 Micro Integrator, you can connect all the different systems that make up your enterprise and build an organization that performs as one seamless digital system.

## Building Centralized, Monolithic Architectures

The heart of WSO2 Micro Integrator is an event-driven, standards-based messaging engine (the **Bus**), which supports message routing, message transformations, and other types of messaging use cases. If your organization uses an API-driven, centralized, integration architecture, WSO2 Micro Integrator can be used as the central integration layer that implements the message mediation logic connecting all the systems, data, events, APIs, etc. in your integration ecosystem.

## Building Decentralized, Cloud-Native Architectures

WSO2 Micro Integrator is also light-weight and container friendly. This allows you to build decentralized, cloud-native integration architectures, while levaraging all the enterprise messaging capabilities of a centralized architecture.

## Graphical Data Flow Designer

WSO2 Micro Integrator is coupled with WSO2 Integration Studio, which is a comprehensive graphical data flow designer for designing and implementing integration use case.
