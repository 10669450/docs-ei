# Introduction

Systems integration is at the heart of any digital transformation. With WSO2 Micro Integrator, you can connect all the different systems that make up your enterprise and build an organization that performs as one seamless digital system.

## Building Centralized, Monolithic Integrations

The heart of WSO2 Micro Integrator is an event-driven, standards-based messaging engine (the **Bus**), which supports message routing, message transformations, and other types of messaging use cases. If your organization uses an API-driven, centralized, integration architecture, WSO2 Micro Integrator can be used as the central integration layer that implements the message mediation logic connecting all the systems, data, events, APIs, etc. in your integration ecosystem.

## Building Decentralized, Cloud-Native Integrations

WSO2 Micro Integrator is also light-weight and container friendly. This allows you to leverage the comprehensive enterprise messaging capabilities of WSO2 Micro Integrator to build and maintain your integrations. 

......

As shown above, if your organization is running on a decentralized, cloud-native, integration architecture where micro services are used for integrating the various APIs, events, and systems, WSO2 Micro Integrator can easily function as  your **Integration** micro services and **API** micro services.

## Graphical Integration Desigining

WSO2 Micro Integrator is coupled with WSO2 Integration Studio, which is a comprehensive graphical data flow designer for designing and implementing integration use case.
