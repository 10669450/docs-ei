# WebSocket Transport

The WebSocket transport implementation of WSO2 Micro Integrator is based on the [WebSocket protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) and consists of an Axis2 sender implementation for WebSockets and secure WebSockets. WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, and can be used by any client or server application. This transport supports bi-directional message mediation.
