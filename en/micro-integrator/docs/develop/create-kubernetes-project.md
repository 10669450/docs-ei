# Creating a Kubernetes Exporter Project

Create a Kubernetes project directory if you want to deploy your integration solutions in a Kubernetes environment. 

The Kubernetes project allows you to package multiple [integration projects](../../develop/creating-projects) into a single Docker image. Also, a file named **integration_cr.yaml** is generated, which can be used to carry out Kubernetes deployments based on the [k8s-ei-operator](../../setup/deployment/kubernetes_deployment/#ei-kubernetes-k8s-operator).

!!! Tip
    If you want to simultaneously create all the projects required for your use case, read about the [integration project solution](../../develop/creating-project-solution).

## Prerequisites
    
It is recommended to [get the latest updates](../../develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio#get-the-latest-updates) for your [WSO2 Integration Studio](../../develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio) before trying these instructions.

## Creating the Kubernetes project

Follow the steps given below.   

1.  Open **WSO2 Integration Studio** and click **Miscellaneous â†’ Create New Kubernetes Project** in the **Getting Started** view as shown below.

4.  Click **Finish**. The Kubernetes project is created in the project explorer. 

## The Kubernetes project directory

Expand the **Kubernetes Exporter Project** in the project explorer. See that the following folders and files are created:

<img src="../../assets/img/create_project/docker_k8s_project/proj_explorer_k8s_project.png" width="400">

## Build and Push Docker images

!!! Info
    **Before you begin**, you need to create your integration artifacts in a [Config](../../develop/creating-projects/#esb-config-proje) project and package the artifacts in a [Composite Application project](../../develop/packaging-artifacts). For example, see the HelloWorld sample given below.
     <img alt="Integration artifacts for Docker" src="../../assets/img/create_project/docker_k8s_project/integration-projects-for-k8s.png" width="300">

Follow the steps given below.

1.  Open the **pom.xml** file inside the Kubernetes project and click **Refresh** on the top-right. Your composite application project with integration artifacts will be listed under **Dependencies** as follows:

    <img alt="Kubernetes pom view" src="../../assets/img/create_project/docker_k8s_project/k8s-pom.png" width="600">
    
2.  Select the composite applications that should be packed inside the Docker image (under **Dependencies**).
3.  If required, you can update the **Target Repository** to which the image should be pushed and the **Target Tag**.
4.  Save the file and click **Build & Push** on the top-right to start the Docker image build-and-push process. The **Enter Docker Registry Credentials** wizard opens.

    <img alt="Docker Registry Auth Details" src="../../assets/img/create_project/docker_k8s_project/k8s-auth.png" width="500">
    
4.  Enter the following details in the wizard:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Parameter
            </th>
            <th>
                Description
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Registry URL Type
            </td>
            <td>
                The Docker image registry to which the image will be pushed: <b>Docker Hub</b> or <b>Other</b>.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Username
            </td>
            <td>
                Username of the target registry repository.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Password
            </td>
            <td>
                Password of the target registry repository.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
5.  Once you enter the above details, click **Push Image**.
6.  First, it will build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile and the Target details. When the image is created, you will see the following message.

    ![Docker Build Success](../assets/img/create_project/docker_k8s_project/build.png)

7.  Finally, it will start to push the image to the given registry. Once the process is completed, you will see the following message.

    ![Docker Push Success](../assets/img/create_project/docker_k8s_project/push.png)
