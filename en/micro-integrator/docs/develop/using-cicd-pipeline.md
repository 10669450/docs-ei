# Using a CICD Pipeline

**Continuous integration(CI)** is the developer practice of merging the source code into a shared repository frequently and verification process to detect errors quickly and fix. The changes are validated using an automated build and test suites upon receiving commits to the master branch. 

**Continuous delivery(CD)** is the process of deploying and delivering the new changes to the customers in a sustainable way. This is achieved by automated deployments of the changes into multiple runtimes such as staging and pre-prod. 

If your release pipeline is automated up to production environment without human interactions, that is the continuous deployment. Having a continuous deployment pipeline increases the confidence of customers, accelerates the feedback loop and finally, it is the success of customers. Building continuous integration and delivery(CI/CD) into your system helps deliver the digital transformation your organization and consumers expect.
