**Audit logs** :

## Managing the growth of Carbon logs

Log growth in [Carbon logs](../monitoring_logs/#carbon-logs) can be managed by the following configurations in the `MI_HOME/repository/conf/log4j.properties` file.

-   **Configurable log rotation**: By default, log rotation is on a daily
    basis.
-   **Log rotation based on time as opposed to size**: This helps to inspect the events that occurred during a specific time.
-   Log files are archived to maximise the use of space.

The log4j- based logging mechanism uses appenders to
append all the log messages into a file. That is, at the end of the log
rotation period, a new file will be created with the appended logs and
archived. The name of the archived log file will always contain the date
on which the file is archived.

## Limiting the size of Carbon log files

You can limit the size of the `MI_HOME/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log` file by following the steps given below. This is useful if you want to
archive the logs and get backups periodically.

1.  Change the `log4j.appender.CARBON_LOGFILE=org.wso2.carbon.utils.logging.appenders.CarbonDailyRollingFileAppender` appender in the
    `MI_HOME/repository/conf/log4j.properties` file as follows:

    ``` java
    log4j.appender.CARBON_LOGFILE=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
    ```

2.  Add the following two properties under `RollingFileAppender`:

    -   `log4j.appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.MaxFileSize=10MB `
    -   `log4j.appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.MaxBackupIndex=20`

        !!! Info
            If the size of the log file is exceeding the value defined in the `MaxFileSize` property, the content is copied to a backup file and the logs are continued to be added to a new empty log file. The `MaxBackupIndex ` property makes the Log4j maintain a maximum number of backup files for the logs.

## Limiting the size of audit log files

In WSO2 servers, audit logs are enabled by default. We can limit the audit log files with theÂ following configuration:

1.  Change the `log4j.appender.AUDIT_LOGFILE=org.wso2.carbon.logging.appenders.CarbonDailyRollingFileAppender ` appender in the `MI_HOME/repository/conf/log4j.properties` file as follows:

    `log4j.appender.AUDIT_LOGFILE=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender`
2.  Add the following two properties under `RollingFileAppender`:
    -   `log4j.appender.AUDIT_LOGFILE.MaxFileSize=10MB`
    -   `log4j.appender.AUDIT_LOGFILE.MaxBackupIndex=20`
