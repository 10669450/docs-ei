# Other Concepts

## Applying security to artifacts

You can apply security to artifacts of the ESB profile using WSO2
Integration Studio. The Quality of Service (QoS) component implements
security.

## Logging messages

You can use the Log mediator to log mediated messages. 

## Message tracing

Message tracing helps you to track issues after an integration process
finishes and thereby, allows you to identify and fix issues by
identifying the root cause. It is used to trace, track and visualize a
body of a message in each intermediate stage of its transmission. T his
is useful for a number of reasons, including auditing and debugging.
