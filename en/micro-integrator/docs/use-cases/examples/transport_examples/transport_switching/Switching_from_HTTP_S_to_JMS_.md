# Sample 251 - Switching from HTTP(S) to JMS

!!! warning

Note that WSO2 EI is shipped with the following changes to what is
mentioned in this documentation :

-   `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/          `
    `           repository/samples/          ` directory that includes
    all Integration profile samplesÂ is changed to
    `           <EI_HOME>/          `
    `           samples/service-bus/          ` .
    `                     `
-   `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/          `
    `           repository/samples/resources/          ` directory that
    includes all artifacts related to the Integration profile samples is
    changed to `           <EI_HOME>/          `
    `           samples/service-bus/resources/          ` .

TEST  

**Objective** : Demonstrate switching from HTTP to JMS.

###### **Prerequisites**

-   Download, install and start a JMS server.
-   Configure sample Axis2 server for JMS.
-   Start the Axis2 server and deploy the
    `          SimpleStockQuoteService         ` .
-   Configure the Synase JMS transport.

``` html/xml
<definitions xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <proxy name="StockQuoteProxy" transports="http">
        <target>
            <endpoint>
                <address uri="jms:/SimpleStockQuoteService?transport.jms.ConnectionFactoryJNDIName=QueueConnectionFactory&amp;
                   java.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory&amp;java.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:61616"/>
            </endpoint>
            <inSequence>
                <property action="set" name="OUT_ONLY" value="true"/>
            </inSequence>
            <outSequence>
                <send/>
            </outSequence>
        </target>
        <publishWSDL uri="file:samples/service-bus/resources/proxy/sample_proxy_1.wsdl"/>
    </proxy>
</definitions>
```

To switch from HTTP to JMS, edit the
`         samples/axis2Server/repository/conf/axis2.xml        ` for the
sample Axis2 server and enable JMS, and restart the server. Now you can
see that the simple stock quote service is available in both JMS and
HTTP in the sample Axis2 server. To see this, point your browser to the
WSDL of the service at
`                   http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService?wsdl                 `
`         . JMS        ` URL for the service is mentioned as below:

``` java
jms:/SimpleStockQuoteService?transport.jms.ConnectionFactoryJNDIName=
QueueConnectionFactory&java.naming.factory.initial=org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory&
java.naming.provider.url=tcp://localhost:61616
```

You may also notice that the simple stock quote Proxy Service exposed in
ESB is now available only in HTTP as we have specified transport for
that service as HTTP. To observe this, access the WSDL of stock quote
proxy service at
`                   http://localhost:8280/services/StockQuoteProxy?wsdl                 `
.

This ESB configuration creates a Proxy Service Samples over HTTP and
forwards received messages to the above EPR using JMS, and sends back
the response to the client over HTTP once the simple stock quote service
responds with the stock quote reply over JMS to the ESB server. To test
this, send a place order request to ESB using HTTP as follows:

``` java
ant stockquote -Daddurl=http://localhost:8280/services/StockQuoteProxy -Dmode=placeorder -Dsymbol=MSFT
```

The sample Axis2 server console will print a message indicating that it
has accepted the order as follows:

``` java
Accepted order for : 18406 stocks of MSFT at $ 83.58806051152119
```
