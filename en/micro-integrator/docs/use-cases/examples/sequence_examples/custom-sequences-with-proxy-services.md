# Custom Sequences with Proxy Services

```
<definitions xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <sequence name="proxy_1">
        <send>
            <endpoint><address uri="http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService"/></endpoint>
        </send>
    </sequence>
    <sequence name="out">
        <send/>
    </sequence>
    <endpoint name="proxy_2_endpoint">
        <address uri="http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService"/>
    </endpoint>
    <localEntry key="proxy_wsdl" src="file:samples/service-bus/resources/proxy/sample_proxy_1.wsdl"/>
    <proxy name="StockQuoteProxy1">
        <publishWSDL key="proxy_wsdl"/>
        <target inSequence="proxy_1" outSequence="out"/>
    </proxy>
    <proxy name="StockQuoteProxy2">
        <publishWSDL key="proxy_wsdl"/>
        <target endpoint="proxy_2_endpoint" outSequence="out"/>
    </proxy>
</definitions>
```

This configuration creates two Proxy Services. The first Proxy Service "StockQuoteProxy1" uses the sequence named "proxy_1" to process incoming messages and the sequence named "out" to process outgoing responses. The second Proxy Service "StockQuoteProxy2" is set to directly forward messages that are received to the endpoint named "proxy_2_endpoint" without any mediation.

You could send a stock quote request to each of these Proxy Services and receive the reply generated by the actual service hosted on the Axis2 instance.

```
ant stockquote -Daddurl=http://localhost:8280/services/StockQuoteProxy1
ant stockquote -Daddurl=http://localhost:8280/services/StockQuoteProxy2
```
