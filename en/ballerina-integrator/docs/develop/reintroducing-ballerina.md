# A Re-introduction to Ballerina Programming Language

Why does the Ballerina programming language need a re-introduction? When Ballerina version 1.0 was released, it was clear that this was a platform geared towards cloud-era application programmers to easily write software that just works. The Ballerina Integrator uses the power of the language to drive a multitude of integration scenarios and empower developers to make integration simple.

WSO2 is the first Ballerina community member to use the new Ballerina programming language in a commercial product, Enterprise Integrator 7.0. In this product, the Ballerina Integrator is leveraged as a powerful code-first approach to programming network-distributed integrations and applications. 

Ballerina was initially developed by WSO2 as an open source, community-driven specification for a full programming language used for network-distributed applications. More information can be found at [http://ballerina.io](http://ballerina.io).

Ballerina incorporates fundamental concepts of distributed system integration into the language and offers a type-safe, concurrent environment to implement microservices with distributed transactions, reliable messaging, stream processing, and workflows.

Based around the interactions of sequence diagrams, Ballerina has built-in support for common integration patterns and connectors, including distributed transactions, compensation and circuit breakers. With first-class support for JSON and XML, Ballerina makes it simple and effective to build robust integration across network endpoints.

With the Ballerina Integrator, developers can directly program integration projects, helping merge siloed coding and waterfall-based integration teams. Low-code alternatives force integration teams to be separate from development teams.
