title: Message broadcasting using topics
---

This guide is about broadcasting a message to several individual services in an asynchronous manner. In this example, the messages are published to a `Topic` in a message broker and there are services subscribed to that topic. Same copy of the message is received by each service and processed individually by each service. The message in fact is broadcasted to the services.

## What you'll build
Let's consider a real world scenario where customers use a doctor channeling service. It facilitates channeling doctors at different hospitals registered in the system. The appointment request is processed by the system and the details are stored in two ways. 

1. In a database - will be used by hospital staff to query the appointments made
2. In a CSV file - will be used by an analytic software system to generate statistics 

Here, the user's doctor appointment request is sent to the `healthcare service`. It makes the appointment and responds with a Json message with appointment details. This message is forwarded to topic called `appointments` created in ActiveMQ broker. If message is forwarded without an issue, user will get successful message acceptance as the response. The service `database_writer` subscribed to the `appointment` topic, will get the appointment details, extract out important data and store the record in `appointments` database in `MySQL`. The service `file_writer` subscribed to the `appointment` topic, will get the same message and add a record to the CSV file called `appointments`. 

> For simplicity, we will omit the requirement of retrying to store the message incase of a failure (i.e temporary DB failure). Note in this example the two operations of storing the record in DB and storing it in the CSV file are completely independent and they are not aware of each other.  

This scenario will cover the following elements of integration 

1. How to receive an HTTP message and invoke an HTTP backend service
2. How to send a message to a Topic created in a JMS broker
3. How to receive a message from a Topic created in a JMS broker
4. How to convert a text message into a Json message
5. How to do a database insert with information extracted from a Json 
6. How to write a CSV file

The following diagram illustrates the scenario:

## Prerequisites
- [Ballerina Distribution](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/)
- A Text Editor or an IDE 
> **Tip**: For a better development experience, install one of the following Ballerina IDE plugins: [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ballerina.ballerina), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina)
- [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/getting-started.html))
  * After you install ActiveMQ, copy the .jar files from the `<AMQ_HOME>/lib` directory to the `<BALLERINA_HOME>/bre/lib` directory.
   * If you use ActiveMQ version 5.12.0, you only have to copy `activemq-client-5.12.0.jar`, `geronimo-j2ee-management_1.1_spec-1.0.1.jar`, and `hawtbuf-1.11.jar` from the `<AMQ_HOME>/lib` directory to the `<BALLERINA_HOME>/bre/lib` directory.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) 
  * After you install MySQL, copy the MySQL connector jar file (download the relevant version from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)) to
    to the `<BALLERINA_HOME>/bre/lib` directory.

## Implementation

TODO: best practices

> If you want to skip the basics and move directly to the [Testing](#testing) section, you can download the project from git and skip the [Implementation](#implementation) instructions.

### Setting up MySQL

* After you install MySQL, source the `database_script` below using MySQL client or `MySQL Workbench` tool. This will create the necessary database, table and set privileges. SQL file can be found at resources/database_script.sql.  

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS healthcare;
USE healthcare;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS APPOINTMENTS (
    AppointmentNumber INT,
    AppointmentDate VARCHAR(200),
    Fee INT,
    Doctor VARCHAR(200),
    Hospital  VARCHAR(200),
    Patient VARCHAR(200),
    Phone VARCHAR(200)
);

CREATE USER wso2@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'wso2'; 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'wso2'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Creating the project structure
Ballerina is a complete programming language that supports custom project structures. 

To implement the scenario in this guide, you can use the following package structure:

```bash
    message-broadcasting
        ├── guide
          ├── database_writer.bal
          ├── file_writer.bal
           └── http_message_receiver.bal
```
     
- Create the above directories in your local machine and also create the empty .bal files.
- Then open a terminal, navigate to project directory and run the Ballerina init command.

```bash
   $ ballerina init
```
Now that you have created the project structure, the next step is to develop the service.

### Developing the service

1. First you need to implement `http_message_receiver.bal` which will listen for HTTP messages over port 9091 and forward it to `healthcare` service. The response from the service is then sent to `appointments` topic of ActiveMQ broker. 
2. Then you need to implement `database_writer.bal` which will listen on the same ActiveMQ topic, receive JMS message, convert it back to a Json message, extract required data and insert the appointment record to `appointments` table we created.   
3. Finally, you need to implement `file_writer.bal` which will listen on the same ActiveMQ topic, receive JMS message, convert it back to a Json message, extract required data and insert the record to a CSV file. Upon every message received, a new record is added to the CSV file. 

Take a look at the code samples below to understand how to implement each service. 

**http_message_receiver.bal**
```ballerina
import ballerina/log;
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/jms;
import ballerina/io;

// Init the HTTP client for appointment service
http:Client appointmentClient = new("http://localhost:9090");

// Initialize a JMS connection with the provider
// 'providerUrl' and 'initialContextFactory' vary based on the JMS provider you use
// 'Apache ActiveMQ' has been used as the message broker in this example
jms:Connection jmsConnection = new({
        initialContextFactory: "org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory",
        providerUrl: "tcp://localhost:61616"
    });

// Initialize a JMS session on top of the created connection
jms:Session jmsSession = new(jmsConnection, {
        acknowledgementMode: "AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE"
    });

// Initialize a topic publisher using the created session
jms:TopicPublisher topicPublisher = new(jmsSession, topicPattern = "appointmentTopic");

// Export http listner port on 9091
listener http:Listener httpListener = new(9091);

// Healthcare Service, which allows users to channel doctors online
@http:ServiceConfig {
    basePath: "/healthcare"
}

    // Resource that allows users to make appointments
    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["POST"],
        consumes: ["application/json"],
        produces: ["application/json"]
    }

                    } else {
                        log:printError("Error occured while adding appointment to the JMS topic");
                        responseMessage = {                             "Message": "Internal error occured while storing the appointment"};
                        clientResponse.statusCode = http:INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR_500;

            }
            // Send response to the user
            clientResponse.setJsonPayload(responseMessage);
            check caller->respond(clientResponse);
        } else {
            clientResponse.statusCode = 400;
            clientResponse.setJsonPayload({
                "Message": "Invalid payload - Not a valid JSON payload"
            });
            check caller->respond(clientResponse);

}
```

## deployment

Once you are done with the development, you can deploy the services using any of the methods listed below. 

### Deploying locally

To deploy locally, navigate to asynchronous-messaging/guide, and execute the following command.

```bash
$ ballerina build
```
This builds a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the services that you developed in the target folder. 
You can run them by 

```bash
$ ballerina run <Exec_Archive_File_Name>
```

### Deploying on Docker

If necessary you can run the service that you developed above as a Docker container.The Ballerina language includes a Ballerina_Docker_Extension, which offers native support to run Ballerina programs on containers.

To run a service as a Docker container, add the corresponding Docker annotations to your service code.

Since ActiveMQ is a prerequisite in this guide, there are a few more steps you need to follow to run the service you developed in a Docker container. Please navigate to [ActiveMQ on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/webcenter/activemq) and follow the instructions. 

MySQL is also a prerequisite in this guide. You can run MySQL on Docker as well. To run MySQL please navigate to [MySQL on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) and follow the instructions.  


## Testing
Follow the steps below to invoke the service.

- On a new terminal, navigate to `<AMQ_HOME>/bin`, and execute the following command to start the ActiveMQ server.
```bash
    $ ./activemq start
```
- Make sure MySQL server is running and the database, tables are created in the instance following the section [Setting up MySQL](###Setting-up-MySQL) 
- Navigate to `message-broadcasting/guide`, and execute the following commands via separate terminals to start each service:
```bash
    $ ballerina run http_message_receiver.bal
    $ ballerina run database_writer.bal
    $ ballerina run file_writer.bal
```

- Create a file called input.json with following json request to simulate placing doctor appointments:
``` json
    {
    "patient": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "dob": "1940-03-19",
        "ssn": "234-23-525",
        "address": "California",
        "phone": "8770586755",
        "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"
    },
    "doctor": "thomas collins",
    "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
    "appointment_date": "2025-04-02"
    }
```
- Send the message using curl 
```bash
    curl -v -X POST --data @input.json http://localhost:9091/healthcare/make_appointment --header "Content-Type:application/json"
```

#### Output
 - You will see the following log, which confirms that the `http_message_receiver` service has sent the request to the ActiveMQ queue.

    ```
    New appointment added to the JMS topic; Patient: John Doe
    ```

 - At the `database_writer` service you will see following log as record is successfully added to the database.  

    ```
    Adding appointment details to the database: {"appointmentNumber":22, "doctor":{"name":"thomas collins", "hospital":"grand oak community hospital", "category":"surgery", "availability":"9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m", "fee":7000.0}, "patient":{"name":"John Doe", "dob":"1940-03-19", "ssn":"234-23-525", "address":"California", "phone":"8770586755", "email":"johndoe@gmail.com"}, "fee":7000.0, "confirmed":false, "appointmentDate":"2025-04-02"}
    ```
- Query MySQL table to see if records are inserted

    ``` sql
    select * from APPOINTMENTS;
    ```

    | AppointmentNumber | AppointmentDate | Fee  | Doctor         | Hospital                     | Patient  | Phone      |
    |-------------------|-----------------|------|----------------|------------------------------|----------|------------|
    | 2                 | 2025-04-02      | 7000 | thomas collins | grand oak community hospital | John Doe | 8770586755 |
        

- Check if a CSV file is created under `message-broadcasting/resources/appointments.csv`

- Navigate to ActiveMQ console (http://localhost:8161/admin/topics.jsp). Number of enqueued and dequeued messages of the topic `appointments` should be `1`.
